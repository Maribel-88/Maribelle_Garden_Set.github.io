## Maribelle Garden Set
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This dynamic website is composed of eight pages , the Home page, About, Contact, Deals, Refund, Terms, Order Status  and the Cart/basket page.

 ### Home Page 
 In the home page , I have implemented some bootstrap , HTML , CSS and small bit of Javascript in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Bootstrap icons made  the web page more engaging.
 I have showcase the products in the home page. I use CSS to design the box/grid where  I placed the items or product.
 I used some Javascript code in order to add items to the cart. The footer in the web page is simply done with HTML code.

 ### Cart Page
 This page is created with some CSS to style the grid and some Bootstrap icons to make it more intersting.
 Also some Javescript to let the user delete some items they don't want in their basket.

### About Page
A very brief welcome and thank you message for the site visitors.

### Contact Page
I used a form to collect basic information from the user which will be use to contact them regarding their query.

### Deals Page
This page offers discount for the buyer.

### Refund Page
This is page is covering the policy on how we refund the customers.

### Terms Page
This pages stipulate the words, names, terms use in the web page.

### Order Status Page
Customers can use this page in order to track the status of their order. They will have to input the order number.
